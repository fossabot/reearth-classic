# Re:Earth Classic

Originally called Re:Earth, the product was separated into Visualiser and Classic following a major revamp. This repository is Classic. This repository is intended to run the existing Re:Earth cloud service without changing the code base of Re:Earth too significantly. No new features will be added, only bug fixes and other maintenance.

See [Re:Earth Visualizer repo](https://github.com/reearth/reearth-visualizer) to access the latest Re:Earth!
